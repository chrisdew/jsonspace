JSON Space
==========

JSON Space is an implementation of a variation of the [TupleSpace](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TupleSpace) and [Blackboard Metaphor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackboard_system#Metaphor).

The goal is to provide a performant, geographically distributed and failure tolerant message switch.

A first concrete implementation will be a [pub/sub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern) messaging system,  This will allowing low-latency intra-continental messaging, while ensuring timely global delivery.
